# Echo Personal Assistant Framework

Echo Personal Assistant Framework is a web-based framework used to control an Arduino-based robot. This robot is a personal assistant and can perform tasks like moving its eyes, eyelids, lips, eyebrows, neck tilt, and twist. The framework allows users to control these different parts of the robot with ease.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Echo Personal Assistant Framework, you'll need to have an Arduino-based robot set up with the required hardware components. You'll also need to have the Arduino IDE installed on your computer.

Once you have the hardware set up, you can clone this repository to your local machine and upload the code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE. You'll also need to set up a web server to run the framework.

## Usage

Once you have the framework set up, you can access it through a web browser. The framework provides a user interface where you can control the different parts of the robot. You can move the eyes, eyelids, lips, eyebrows, neck tilt, and twist using the interface.

The framework also allows you to save different configurations for the robot. This can be useful if you want the robot to perform a specific task or move in a certain way.

## Technology

The Echo Personal Assistant Framework is built using the following technologies:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend
- Node.js and Express.js for the backend
- Socket.IO for real-time communication between the frontend and backend
- Johnny-Five for communicating with the Arduino board
